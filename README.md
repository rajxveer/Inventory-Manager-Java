# Inventory-Manager-Java

This is actually as assignment I did with a group back in 2019 for my Object Oriented Programminng (OOP) module with Java. 

Fun fact, this was my first ever application that I made. Yeap, my first ever application was made with Java, not Python. Why? I don't know, go figure!
