# Inventory-Manager-Java

This is actually as assignment I did with a group back in 2019 for my Object Oriented Programminng (OOP) module with Java using the Eclipse IDE. 

Ignore the bin folder and just focus on the src folder instead. 

Fun fact, this was my first ever application that I made. Yeap, my first ever application was made with Java, not Python. Back then I had just joined the Computer Science degree after completing my foundation in a computing related course at a seperate university. When I was doing my foundation, I was not taught any programming whatsoever, so I was extremely nervous when I joined my degree course and suddenly had to learn Java for my first semester as my first ever programming language. 

Why? I don't know, go figure!
